# ML-Algos-from-Scratch
This is an implementation of various basic ML-Algos from the scratch without using anything from the sklearn library



This repository has algorithms like SVM Linear Classifier , Logistic Regression , Softmax Regression ( for multiclass classification ) and a modified K-Mean clustering algorithm called K-Means ++  .      

Just download the .py files and run them in your local machine to get the results.


##### All the algorithms have been tested using the IRIS Dataset ..  ########



I will be updating this repository time to time .
